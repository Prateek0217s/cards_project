 Project Description: Job Cards UI using React.js

This project focuses on building a dynamic and reusable card-based user interface using React.js to display job listings in a modern and responsive layout. Each card represents a job opening and includes key details such as the company logo, job title, company name, location, employment type, experience level, pay rate per hour, and posting time.

The application leverages React components and props to ensure modularity and reusability, making it easy to scale or update job data. Job information is stored in structured JavaScript objects and rendered efficiently using array mapping. The UI is designed to be clean and user-friendly, with proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of component-based architecture, state management basics, and frontend UI design principles. It can be extended further by adding features such as filtering by job type, search functionality, API integration, and dark mode support.
